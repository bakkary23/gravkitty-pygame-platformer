# Gravkitty


Overview and Target Audience:
  The final product of this project is a simple platformer game called Gravkitty. The main unique feature of this game compared to 
  other platformers is that instead of a jump mechanic, there is a gravity switch mechanic, in which the direction of gravity will switch, 
  making the player alternate between walking on the ceiling and walking on the ground. Since Gravkitty is a video game, or in other words, 
  an entertainment item, the problem that it is a solution to is one of boredom. In theory, Gravkitty is meant for people who feel like playing 
  a quick platforming game. The game is very straightforward, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages due to the simplicity of the controls 
  and the intentional use of graphic design to make the goal of the game clear (the end goal being a flag, etc.). The level of technical expertise
  to use Gravkitty is very low, as someone just needs to be able to use a computer enough to open the file. Finally, in theory, the motivation 
  of someone using Gravkitty is to have fun, but realistically it will be mostly used by my friends and acquaintances as a way for me to
  update them on how much progress Iâ€™ve made in learning how to program.
